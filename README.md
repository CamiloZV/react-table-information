## React FIT

This project serves as a demonstration of my proficiency with React 18 and TypeScript, specifically created for a technical interview.

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- Material-UI
- RTK Query
- Jest
- MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Husky

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to showcase my current abilities with React 18 and TypeScript. It includes a set of technologies commonly used in modern React development to highlight my skills in building scalable and maintainable applications.

## Scripts

# Build

- npm build
- Builds the production-ready application.

# Test

- npm run lint
- Runs ESLint to check for linting issues.

# Lint:Fix

- npm run lint:fix
- runs ESLint with the --fix option to automatically fix linting issues.

# Format

- npm run format
- Runs Prettier to format code according to the configured rules.

# Prepare

- npm run prepare
- Installs Husky hooks.

# Test:Coverage

- npm run test:coverage
- Runs Jest with coverage reporting.

## Code Quality

This project follows the Airbnb style guide for maintaining code quality. ESLint and Prettier are configured to enforce coding standards, and Husky is set up to run pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality before each commit.

## Api Calls

RTK Query is used to manage API calls efficiently and handle data fetching and caching seamlessly.
